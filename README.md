# Files_Editor

**Files_Editor** is a repository that centralizes and documents recurring processes and automations related to video editing through scripts. The goal is to streamline and simplify repetitive tasks in image and video manipulation.

Currently, the repository includes two main projects:

- **Frame_overlay**: Automates the overlay of images on video frames, optimized for use with **EbSynth**.
- **Frames_select**: Automates the selection of keyframes based on motion blur analysis, providing more stable frames for processing in **EbSynth**.

Each folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed instructions and usage guidelines.

## Future of the Repository

This repository will continue to grow as more processes are documented and automated. **Files_Editor** aims to be a comprehensive collection of scripts and tools for improving efficiency in video and image processing.
