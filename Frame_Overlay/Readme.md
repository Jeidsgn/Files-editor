# Frame Overlay Toolkit for EbSynth

This Python toolkit is an auxiliary tool designed to streamline and automate tasks related to the image processing workflow when using **EbSynth**. EbSynth relies on images that are compared by their filenames and must be of the same size, which this toolkit helps ensure. Additionally, the output generated by EbSynth is often segmented into multiple sub-clips rendered as individual images, which can then be further processed and automated using this script.

## Features

### 1. **Renaming Files**
This function renames image files from one folder by copying the filenames from another folder. It ensures consistency between the "original" and "edited" images, which is crucial for EbSynth to process images accurately.

- **Input**: Two folders with matching image counts.
- **Output**: The edited images renamed to match the filenames of the originals.

### 2. **Resizing Images**
EbSynth requires images to be of the same dimensions. This function resizes images to a specified resolution (e.g., 720x1280 pixels) to maintain consistency across all input files.

- **Input**: A folder with images.
- **Output**: Resized images in the same folder, ready for EbSynth.

### 3. **Subdividing Images into Folders**
Since EbSynth often outputs multiple sub-clips as individual images, this function subdivides those images into numbered subfolders (e.g., 18 images per folder) for easier management and further processing.

- **Input**: A folder with EbSynth output images.
- **Output**: New subfolders containing batches of images, simplifying clip management.

### 4. **Image Overlay with Opacity Control**
This function blends images with varying opacity based on their position relative to keyframes. This is particularly useful for combining multiple render passes or overlaying effects on top of the original EbSynth output.

- **Input**: Folders containing sequences of images (following the `out_` naming convention).
- **Output**: Blended images saved in a new folder for further use.

### 5. **Create Video from Image Sequence**
After EbSynth processes the images and they are ready, this function creates a video from the sequence of images, ideal for previewing or finalizing the animation created.

- **Input**: A folder with processed images.
- **Output**: A video file in MP4 format.

## Usage

This toolkit is designed to be used within a **Jupyter Notebook** environment, making it easy to customize and execute individual tasks as needed for your EbSynth workflow. Each section of the code can be run independently to rename, resize, subdivide, overlay, or convert images to video, streamlining the entire animation process.

## Example Workflow

1. **Rename** the edited frames to match the original keyframes.
2. **Resize** all frames to the same dimensions to meet EbSynth requirements.
3. **Subdivide** the output images into smaller sub-clips for easier management.
4. **Overlay** frames to apply transparency effects.
5. **Create a video** from the final image sequence to preview the results.

This process automates much of the manual work, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects of your animation and visual effects.
